FE1.1s B (SSOP28) Layout Guide V1.0
-----------------------------------

 1. All bypass 0.1uF caps, please use size of 0603 and should be 
 	as close as possible to the IC(FE1.1s).
 2. Two 0.1uF/16V/0603 capacitors, C3 and C5 must close to FE1.1s pin 20
 	(VDD5), also the current path must through the capacitors first before
 	entering the pin 20(VDD5).
 3. DP, DM Differential trace impedance = [ DP & DM ] = 90 ohm,
 	and do not jump the DP DM signals that will cause impedance miss match.
 4. VDD5(pin 20) to VD33_O(pin 21) max current 500mA
 5. The DP, DM signal-line should keep 40 mil away from other lines, 
	and the bottom layer should flood with GND (preventing the GND cut).
 6. Keep the components out of the XTAL, which also keeping away from DP, DM 
 	signals. The bottom layer of XTAL should flood with GND. The shell of XTAL
 	should not connect to the PCB, that will inject the noise to the PCB.
 7. The coupling resistor (2.7k+-1%) of the REXT (pin 14) should be 
 	as close as possible to the IC, and punch 3 more ground vias at ground side
 	of the resistor.
 8. Pin 1 (VSS) is the only GND pin, and should be grounded efficiently, means
 	punching more GND VIAs near by, at least 5 GND vias, as possible.
 9. Please refer to the schematic of current path, carefulling the line-width 
 	of major current path.
10. The length of 5 couples of DP, DM signal-line, including upstream and all 
	downstream ports,  should no less than 1500 mil with 10 of 45-degree-angle, 
	which will degrade the DP DM driving strength in order to pass USB-IF 
	requirement only. If not, the shorter and straighter DP DM signal line, make 
	longer transaction capability (more than 5 meter).
11. Make less jump to the power line. If doing jump of power line,at least 2 of 
	1mm through holes, need to be drilled. If through holes smaller than 1mm, 
	the number of holes should be doubled.
12. Downstream port's capacitor, 100uF, must as close to each USB connector's 
	Vbus5V as possible.
13. Fuse(2.5A) need to be low drop type if used.
14. Net of OVCJ and R8 to VCC_5V should be less than 400 mil, leaving far 
	away from any USB connector, and the net's bottom layer should flood with 
	GND (preventing the GND cut), this can prevent the interference of ESD.
15. USB connector's shielding ground should connect to the GND directly without 
	GND cut, and punch more ground vias (10 via/cm^2), this can reduce 
	EMI effect.
16. Adding a Bead/100MHZ/470ohm/2A on Vbus 5V at USB upstream connector could 
	reduce noise from PC(Host).
17. In stead of using power line, the power plane have better stability 
	against to EFT(Electrical Fast Transient).
